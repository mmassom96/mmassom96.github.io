    <span class=name>Hi, my name is Matthew Massom</span>
    <br style="line-height: 250%">
    <span class=bio>I am an engineering student at Purdue University Northwest. I will graduate in December
        2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and minors in Electrical Engineering
        and Computer Science. I have held two internships at Sullair, LLC in Michigan
        City, Indiana. In my first internship, I worked as an Electrical Engineering Intern 
        and in my second internship, I worked as an Embedded Controls Engineering Intern. I have
        a passion for problem solving and learning. My strongest skills include object-oriented
        programming, Linux operating systems, Python scripting, and team leadership.
