            I was born on July 21, 1996 in Valparaiso, Indiana. I have lived in Northwest Indiana my entire life, but I 
            do enjoy traveling to new places whenever I get the opportunity. In my spare time, I enjoy woodworking, baseball, 
            working on cars, and tinkering with anything that I can get my hands on.
